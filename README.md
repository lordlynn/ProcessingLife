## Conway's Game of Life
This project implements Conway's Game of Life in Processing with a twist.

 Cells are colored differently depending on how long it has been since they were last alive. This can lead to some interesting abstract art.

 Starting the game with every cell alive leads to a symmetrical result that changes from balanced to chaotic with time.
